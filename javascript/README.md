# JavaScript

Integral to the modern web, Javascript is an untyped, dynamic, interpreted programming language. If your web page needs to be interactive, Javascript is a great choice. Because it is interpreted in the browser, you need to special program to create usable code. All major web browsers support it and it is one of the only universally-supported client-side scripting languages.
 
Javascript is**not**Java -- Java was just extemely popular at the time Brendan Eich invented it over at Netscape. Javascript's official name is ECMAScript, sometimes shorted to ES followed by the version. The latest version is ES6, released in 2015.
